# 🎯 Mastermind - Console Game 🎨  

Mastermind is a **code-breaking** game where you must guess a **secret combination of colors** within **10 attempts**.  

## 🕹️ How to Play  

- The secret combination consists of a sequence of **four colors**, chosen from the following:  

  **red (r) - Blue (B) - Yellow (Y) - Green (G) - Orange (O) - Purple (P)**  

- Enter your guess using the **initials** of the colors in lowercase/uppercase as shown.  
  - Example: `rybg` (red, yellow, blue, green)  

- After each attempt, you will receive **feedback** in the form of black and white pegs:  

## ⚫⚪ Feedback System  

- **⚫ Black Peg:** A color is **correct and in the right position**.  
- **⚪ White Peg:** A color is **correct but in the wrong position**.  
- No peg means the color is **not in the combination**.
